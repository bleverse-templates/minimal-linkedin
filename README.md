## A Browser Extension for Enhanced LinkedIn Experience

Minimal LinkedIn is a streamlined, user-centric browser extension crafted to redefine and enhance your LinkedIn browsing experience. We've taken the original LinkedIn design and transformed it into a more minimalistic, visually appealing interface that optimizes readability and user interaction.

Our project aims to eliminate the unnecessary clutter and distractions present in the current design, providing a cleaner, more professional look that allows users to focus more on the content. By focusing on simplicity, we've managed to offer a user interface that's not only easy on the eyes, but also significantly improves the overall browsing experience.

This repository houses all the necessary code and resources to enable the extension on your browser. By contributing to this project, you can help shape the future of LinkedIn browsing. Whether you're an experienced developer or a LinkedIn user passionate about improving digital spaces, we welcome your input.
